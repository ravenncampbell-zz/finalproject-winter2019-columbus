            <h1>About Us</h1>
             <p>Since 2008 we have been serving up our homemade ice creams to our community 
             in Bronx, New York. Here at Sundaes Ice Cream Place our ice creams are made with 
             the freshest ingredients from our local farmers markets, and we offer a variety 
             of flavors. We have traditional flavors like vanilla and chocolate, and seasonal
             flavors like rum raisin and black cherry fudge. New flavors are frequently added 
             to our menu. So, there is always something for everyone. You can create our signature 
             sundaes, with as many flavors and toppings as you want.  Our milkshakes and ice cream
             floats, come highly recommended as well.</p> <br />
            <p>Over the past 11 years we have gotten to know our customers on a personal level,
            and they have truly become a part of our extended family. We appreciate your continual 
            kindness and support. So, come down to visit us today. We love having you here.</p>
